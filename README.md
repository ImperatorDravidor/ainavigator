### The Challenge We Solve

AI adoption often fails due to:
- 🚫 **Emotional resistance** from stakeholders
- 📉 **Unclear capability levels** across the organization
- 🤷 **Uncertainty in decision-making** about where to invest
- 🧩 **Complex tools** that require extensive training

### Our Solution

AI Navigator reveals both **sentiment-based blockers** (how people feel) and **capability-based maturity levels** (how ready the organization is), then guides you toward high-impact actions through an **intelligent conversational interface** that anyone can use.

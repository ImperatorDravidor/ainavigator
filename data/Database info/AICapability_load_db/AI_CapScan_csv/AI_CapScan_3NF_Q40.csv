"Data quality is still insufficient. There are few real use cases to apply AI. In my opinion, actually applying AI is still in its infancy. We talk about it a lot, but in practice, it’s still difficult to integrate AI into work processes.",020cc613
"Data management (in terms of organization, governance, and technology). Knowledge (developers).",87417b83
"The lack of a clear data foundation ensuring data availability, integrity, and confidentiality. This is a prerequisite for effectively using and trusting AI outcomes. In addition, there is a high degree of overconfidence (lack of self-awareness/realism) regarding knowledge, skills, and expectations of AI’s actual benefits. Much incorrect goal rhetoric occurs: treating AI as a product that magically adds value instead of as a tool that helps us add value.",ee430f9a
"The foundation of processes and data is not yet sufficiently in order everywhere to achieve meaningful acceleration with AI. In addition, properly weighing initiatives based on value — and then capturing that value — is too difficult for many departments.",66e763ac
Adjusting the organization and adding new skills so that Vitens can start leveraging AI.,8dbf631d
"Knowledge & expertise, culture.",ea125c96
"Frameworks, data quality.",d1104d1e
"Data classification, governance, and lack of insight into the use of AI tools within the organization.",88d1b9c4
Privacy and security requirements. Budget. Too few people with knowledge and courage.,7562212b
"The field of AI opportunities is vast, deep, and broad. We need to choose and facilitate tools and support where AI’s learning impact is greatest — addressing issues such as workload, labor shortages, and innovation. The challenge is to dare to optimize one’s own work processes with AI, even if it might make roles less central (prejudice!). This means turning AI’s perceived threat into opportunities for functionality, knowledge enrichment, and craftsmanship. In production processes, AI should help make our infrastructure more resilient — learning to work with scenarios, recovering from incidents, and improving decision-making even with scarce data (“doing more now with less is often better than waiting for more”). The challenge is to empower professionals and enhance the impact of their decisions.",6148179d
Technical implementation (embedding into existing processes).,f9095c29
Little knowledge about what is possible. Unclear what Vitens’ policy is in this area. No clear strategy for deploying AI or allocating resources.,8b00d502
Availability of data + AI models that are allowed to work with that data.,b6f6e770
"Development of a secure environment to store all our templates, previous tenders, and procurement law. The AI agent will assist in various steps of the procurement process: • Writing RFPs, • Answering clarification questions, • Writing award and rejection letters, etc.",a1750e0e
Knowledge and understanding — only then can we gain (better) practical perspectives for action.,689db19b
That there is still much unfamiliarity with working with AI and no unified strategy.,2fad5aa3

No clear view of the challenges related to implementing AI within the organization.,6acb08b8
Making data suitable (quality-wise) and available for AI use.,d78b2f83
"No clear AI strategy yet, including a safe experimental and development space for colleagues to explore and experience AI in their work.",67c3e777
Unclear choices regarding which tools we can use. Little proactivity in experimenting with various AI systems across departments. A lot (too much?) focus on security risks compared to opportunities.,d1f66074
Employees’ digital competencies and the strict policies around data and IT landscape.,71e1681b
Further developing process automation toward being more AI-driven. AI in M&O (Maintenance & Operations) business processes.,6f70f198
Insufficient support in developing AI applications for our processes. It should start with analysis. AI is not yet properly embedded within the department; first collaboration with Business Development has started.,f7c562e4
"AI is perceived as threatening by many people. It inherently interferes with what people see as “their” work, which slows adoption and causes resistance. A key challenge is creating a culture of trust and collaboration so we can benefit from AI without undermining one another.",6216a268

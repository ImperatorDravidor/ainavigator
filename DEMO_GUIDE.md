## üéØ **30-Second Elevator Pitch**

*"We help companies understand if they're ready for AI transformation. Most companies fail at AI adoption‚Äînot because of technology, but because their people aren't ready. We survey your employees, analyze both their sentiment AND capabilities, then show you exactly what to fix."*

## üìù **Common Questions & Answers**

**Q: How is this different from a regular employee survey?**
*A: We combine sentiment (emotions) with capability (skills/infrastructure). Most surveys only measure one dimension. We also benchmark against industry peers and use AI to analyze qualitative responses.*

**Q: How long does an assessment take?**
*A: Survey takes employees 10-15 minutes. We process data and generate insights in 48-72 hours. Live presentation to executives is 20-30 minutes.*

**Q: What's your data security?**
*A: Enterprise-grade: SOC2 Type II, AES-256 encryption, GDPR compliant, data residency controls. Employee responses are anonymized and aggregated.*

**Q: Can we customize for our industry?**
*A: Yes. Benchmarks are industry-specific, and we can adjust dimensions to your context (e.g., healthcare compliance, financial services regulations).*

**Q: What happens after the assessment?**
*A: We provide a detailed action plan with prioritized interventions. Many clients engage us for implementation support - change management, training programs, communication strategies.*

**Q: How accurate is the AI analysis?**
*A: Our AI synthesizes patterns from thousands of responses. We combine GPT-4 analysis with our proprietary framework. Results are validated by our consulting team before delivery.*

## üèÜ **Success Metrics to Mention**

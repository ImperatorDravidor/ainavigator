- ❌ Historical comparison (single assessment)
- ❌ Custom branding (use default LeadingWith.AI branding)
- ❌ PowerPoint export (PDF is enough)
- ❌ Real-time collaboration

## 🎯 Minimum Viable Demo (6 Hours - If Time Constrained)

If you need a working demo FAST, prioritize:

### **Must Have** (6 hours):
1. **GPT Problem Categories** (3 hours)
   - Just problem categories, skip interventions
   - Use simpler prompts
   - Mock some responses if needed

2. **Capability Overview Chart** (2 hours)
   - Just the radar, skip drilldown
   - Use static benchmarks
   - No navigation

3. **One Filter Working** (1 hour)
   - Just department filter
   - Apply to sentiment only

### **Can Demo Without**:
- PDF Export (show screenshots instead)
- Full intervention details
- Dimension drilldown
- Multiple filters

---

## 💡 Recommendation

### **Option A: Full MVP (8-10 hours)**
Deliver complete experience per PRD
- **Pros**: Production-ready, fully functional
- **Cons**: Requires 2 full days

### **Option B: Demo MVP (6 hours)**
Deliver core experience with shortcuts
- **Pros**: Can demo today
- **Cons**: Some features mocked

### **Option C: Iterative (2-3 days)**
Build Phase 1, test, build Phase 2, test, etc.
- **Pros**: Highest quality, test as you go
- **Cons**: Takes longer

## 🔥 What Would Make This "WOW"

Beyond MVP, these would elevate the experience:

1. **Real-time GPT streaming** - Watch insights generate live
2. **Interactive benchmark comparison** - Slide between industries
3. **Drill-anywhere** - Click any number to see raw data
4. **Shareable links** - Send specific views to stakeholders
5. **Presentation mode** - Hide controls, full-screen polish
6. **Voice-over narration** - Audio guide through findings
7. **Mobile responsive** - Works on executive iPads

---

## 📝 Current Visual Flow Issues

### What Needs Polish:

1. **Transitions**
   - Some view changes are abrupt
   - Need consistent animation timing
   - Missing breadcrumb navigation

2. **Empty States**
   - Capability shows nothing (broken)
   - Filters show empty panel
   - Need better "coming soon" states

3. **Loading States**
   - No spinners for GPT calls
   - No progress indicators
   - Unclear when processing

4. **Error States**
   - No error messages
   - No retry options
   - Silent failures

5. **Heatmap Improvements Needed**
   - Cell hover tooltips could be richer
   - Legend could be clearer
   - Mobile responsiveness needs work
   - Print view needs optimization

---

## ✅ Verdict: Do We Have MVP?

**NO** - But we're close (45-50% there)

**What We Have:**
- Professional foundation
- Correct data model
- Beautiful UI for sentiment
- Proper authentication

**What's Blocking:**
- No GPT integration (can't deliver core value)
- No capability visualization (only half the product)
- No real filtering (can't segment data)

**Time to MVP:** 8-10 focused hours across 4 phases

**Recommendation:** Prioritize Phase 1 (GPT) + Phase 2 (Capability) to reach 80% MVP in 7-8 hours.

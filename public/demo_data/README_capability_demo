# Milestone 3 — Capability Flow Data Deliverables

**Owner:** Data Science / Engineering  
**Date:** October 2025  
**Purpose:**  
This dataset powers the **Capability Flow** in Milestone 3 (Sections 6.3 – 6.4).  
It supports backend endpoints, radar and drilldown visualisations, benchmarking, and filters.

## Files Overview

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `capability_demo.csv` | Main dataset combining all capability scores (8 dimensions × 4 constructs), including synthetic filters (industry, country, continent, role). |
| `constructs.csv` | Metadata mapping construct → dimension, used for drilldown radar labels and API lookups. |
| `dimensions.csv` | Metadata for the 8 capability dimensions, used for the top-level radar chart. |
| `README.md` | Schema and integration guide. |

## Data Schema — `capability_demo.csv`

| Column | Description | Example |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| `ResponseId_id` | Unique respondent identifier | 0046a5e5 |
| `dimension_id` | Numeric ID of the capability dimension (1 – 8) | 3 |
| `dimension` | Name of the capability dimension | Technology |
| `construct_id` | Numeric ID of the construct (1 – 32) | 9 |
| `construct` | Name of the construct | Data Architecture |
| `score` | Numeric score (1 – 5 scale) | 4.2 |
| `industry_synthetic` | Synthetic industry segment | Manufacturing |
| `country_synthetic` | Synthetic country (local region) | Netherlands |
| `continent_synthetic` | Synthetic continent (global region) | Europe |
| `role_synthetic` | Synthetic organisational role | Leadership |

## Backend Endpoint Alignment

| API | Purpose | Uses Columns |
|-----|----------|--------------|
| `GET /api/capability/dimensions` | Calculate average/min–max scores per dimension | `dimension`, `score`, filters |
| `GET /api/capability/constructs/:dimensionId` | Return 4 construct scores for selected dimension | `dimension_id`, `construct`, `score` |
| `GET /api/benchmark/:industry/:region` | Compare results with synthetic benchmarks | `industry_synthetic`, `continent_synthetic` |
| `POST /api/capability/summarize` *(optional)* | Generate AI summarisation of open responses | `open_responses.csv` + filters |

---

## Filter System

These columns enable cross-view filtering between sentiment and capability flows:

| Filter | Column | Example |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Industry | `industry_synthetic` | Finance |
| Country (Local) | `country_synthetic` | Netherlands |
| Continent (Global) | `continent_synthetic` | Europe |
| Role / Segment | `role_synthetic` | Staff |

---

## Dimensions Overview

| ID | Dimension |
|----|------------|
| 1 | Strategy and Vision |
| 2 | Data |
| 3 | Technology |
| 4 | Talent and Skills |
| 5 | Organisation and Processes |
| 6 | Innovation |
| 7 | Adaptation & Adoption |
| 8 | Ethics and Responsibility |

Each dimension contains 4 constructs → 32 constructs total.

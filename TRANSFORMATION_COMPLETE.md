2. **Ask follow-ups**: Build on previous answers
3. **Use context**: AI remembers the conversation
4. **Request actions**: "Generate...", "Show...", "Compare..."

### For Admins
1. **Better data = Better insights**: Ensure data quality
2. **Monitor costs**: Track OpenAI API usage
3. **Gather feedback**: Learn what questions users ask
4. **Iterate prompts**: Customize the AI's knowledge over time

### For Developers

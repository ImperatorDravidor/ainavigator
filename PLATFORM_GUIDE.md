## Platform Overview

### What is AI Navigator?

AI Navigator is an enterprise-grade AI readiness assessment platform that helps organizations:
- Measure employee sentiment toward AI adoption
- Assess organizational capability across 8 key dimensions
- Identify resistance patterns and capability gaps
- Recommend targeted interventions
- **Track improvement over time through multi-phase assessments (NEW!)**
- **Measure intervention effectiveness with before/after comparison**
- **Demonstrate ROI with data-driven transformation journeys**

### Core Methodology

The platform combines two assessment frameworks:

1. **Sentiment Analysis** (25-dimension heatmap)
   - 5 Resistance Levels × 5 Concern Categories
   - Measures emotional readiness and resistance blockers
   - Ranks areas from #1 (best/lowest resistance) to #25 (worst/highest resistance)

2. **Capability Assessment** (8-dimension diamond)
   - Strategy & Vision, Data, Technology, Talent & Skills
   - Organization & Processes, Innovation, Adaptation & Adoption
   - Ethics & Responsibility
   - Each dimension scored on 1-10 maturity scale

## Multi-Phase Journey System

### 🚀 **NEW: Temporal Tracking & Progress Measurement**

The platform now supports **time-series comparison** across multiple assessment periods, enabling you to:
- Establish baseline measurements (Phase 1)
- Track which interventions were implemented
- Import new assessment snapshots (Phase 2, Phase 3, etc.)
- Compare progress over time with visual indicators
- Measure actual intervention impact with before/after data
- Demonstrate ROI to stakeholders with data-driven evidence

### Understanding the 3-Phase Journey

#### **Phase 1: Oct 2024 Baseline**

- Average capability: 4.25/5.0 (intermediate maturity)
- 500 employee responses
- 25 sentiment zones + 8 capability dimensions measured

**Strategic decision:**
Based on baseline data, leadership selected **3 initial interventions**:
1. **A1: AI Strategy & Governance Framework** ($250K, 12 weeks)
2. **B2: AI Literacy & Training Program** ($200K, 8 weeks)

6. **C2: AI Product Development Pipeline** ($75K, 8 weeks)

Total Phase 2 additional investment: **$250K**
**Cumulative investment: $850K**

#### **Phase 3: Nov 2025 Transformation**

**What it represents:**

## Tips & Best Practices

### For Team Leaders

1. **Start with Overview**: Get the big picture before diving deep
2. **Use filters strategically**: Analyze by department to find specific issues
3. **Don't ignore green cells**: They show what's working - replicate success
4. **Commit to interventions**: Track what you plan to implement
5. **Review phase-by-phase**: Don't skip baseline data

### For Executives

1. **Focus on Impact Analysis**: Shows ROI of your AI initiatives
2. **Use AI Agent**: Ask strategic questions, get instant answers
3. **Export reports**: Share PDF summaries with stakeholders
4. **Watch benchmark comparisons**: Know where you stand vs industry
5. **Track time-series**: Use phase selector to show board progress

### For HR/Change Management

1. **Drill into dimensions**: Understand capability gaps at construct level
2. **Read open-ended responses**: Qualitative insights complement quantitative data
3. **Browse all intervention types**: Match approach to company culture
4. **Filter by effort level**: Balance quick wins with strategic initiatives
5. **Use sentiment + capability together**: Holistic view of readiness

### For Data Analysts

1. **Explore variance view**: Understand score distribution
2. **Check response counts**: Low counts may need more data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue: "No data showing in heatmap"

**Solution**:
- Check if filters are too restrictive
- Verify assessment period is correct
- Try "Clear all filters" button
- Refresh the page

#### Issue: "AI Insights button not working"

**Solution**:
- Ensure at least 1 problem area exists (resistance > 2.0)
- Check internet connection
- Clear browser cache
- Try again after page refresh

#### Issue: "Cannot see Phase 2/3 data"

**Solution**:
- Verify your organization has completed those assessments
- Check assessment period selector in top-right
- Contact admin if data should exist but doesn't appear

#### Issue: "Radar chart shows only one line"

**Solution**:
- Switch assessment period to Phase 2 or Phase 3 to see multiple phases
- Baseline only shows current data (no historical comparison)
- If in Phase 2/3 and still only one line, baseline data may be missing

#### Issue: "Committed interventions disappeared"

**Solution**:
- Commitments are stored in browser localStorage
- Clearing browser data removes commitments
- Use same browser/device to maintain commitments
- Export a report to save your selections externally

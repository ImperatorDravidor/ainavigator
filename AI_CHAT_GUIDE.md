You: What are our top 3 problem areas in sentiment analysis?

AI: Based on your sentiment data (247 responses), here are the top 3 areas of concern:

1. üìä Career √ó Too Opaque (Score: 2.34/5.0)
   - 42 employees affected
   - Employees worry about AI's lack of transparency affecting career decisions
   - Critical severity

2. üè¢ Organizational √ó Too Autonomous (Score: 2.51/5.0)
   - 38 employees affected

   - 35 employees affected
   - Teams struggle with AI's inability to read social cues
   - High severity

Would you like me to generate intervention recommendations for any of these?
```

### üìà Capability Assessment
```
You: How mature is our AI capability overall?

AI: Looking at your capability assessment data (156 responses across 7 dimensions):

**Overall Maturity: 2.8/5.0 (Developing)**

Your organization is in the "Developing" stage - you have foundational elements in place but significant gaps remain.

**Strongest Dimensions:**
‚úÖ Strategy & Vision (3.4/5.0) - Clear AI vision and executive support
‚úÖ Technology & Tools (3.2/5.0) - Good infrastructure foundation

**Weakest Dimensions:**
‚ö†Ô∏è Data & Infrastructure (2.1/5.0) - Data quality and governance gaps
‚ö†Ô∏è Talent & Skills (2.3/5.0) - Skills shortage, training needed

**Recommended Focus:**
Start with Data & Infrastructure - it's your biggest blocker and prerequisite for other dimensions. I can generate a detailed action plan if you'd like!
```

### üéØ Navigation Help
```
You: How do I see department-level sentiment breakdown?

AI: Great question! Here's how to view department-level sentiment:

1. Navigate to the **Dashboard** page (click "Dashboard" in the top nav)
2. Look for the **Filter Panel** on the left side
3. Under "Department", select the specific departments you want to analyze
4. The sentiment heatmap will automatically update to show only those departments

You can also:
- Compare multiple departments by selecting more than one
- Combine with other filters (region, age group, etc.)
- Export the filtered view for reports

Currently you're on the [current page]. Would you like me to guide you there?
```

### üìã Report Generation
```
You: Create an executive summary for our board meeting

AI: I'll generate a comprehensive executive summary. One moment...

**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: AI READINESS ASSESSMENT**
*Organization: [Your Organization] | Date: [Current Date]*

**Current State:**
Our organization is in the early "Developing" stage of AI maturity (2.8/5.0). We have strong strategic vision and executive commitment, but face critical gaps in data infrastructure and talent readiness that are blocking progress.

**Key Findings:**
- 247 employees surveyed across sentiment dimensions
- Primary concerns: Career transparency (2.34/5.0), organizational autonomy (2.51/5.0)
- Capability varies widely: Strategy (3.4) vs. Data (2.1) = 1.3 point gap
- Cultural readiness mixed: 62% optimistic about AI, 38% deeply concerned

**Top 3 Priorities:**
1. **Data Foundation**: Address data quality and governance gaps (current: 2.1/5.0)
2. **Transparency Program**: Launch "Explainable AI" initiative to address career concerns
3. **Talent Development**: Implement comprehensive upskilling program

**Recommended First Step:**
Form a Data Governance Task Force (4-6 weeks, $25-50K) to establish data standards, quality metrics, and stewardship processes. This unblocks all other AI initiatives.

Would you like me to generate detailed intervention plans for any of these priorities?

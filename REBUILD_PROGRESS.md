# AI Navigator Rebuild - Progress Report
**Correct Implementation Based on Actual Data Model**

## What Was Wrong (Original Build)
- ❌ Made-up labels ("sentiment level × reason")
- ❌ Absolute color thresholds instead of relative ranking
- ❌ No understanding of actual 5×5 grid meaning
- ❌ Fake "AI insights" (hardcoded strings)
- ❌ Generic interventions not matched to real gaps
- ❌ No GPT-4 integration
- ❌ Wrong product positioning (survey tool vs consulting platform)

## What's Correct Now

### ✅ Data Model Understanding
- Sentiment: 5 levels (Personal → Organizational) × 5 AI characteristics
- Capability: 8 dimensions × 4 constructs each = 32 total
- Scoring: 4-point scale (A, More A, More B, B) averaged across respondents
- Coloring: Relative ranking within filtered dataset (top 3, top 8, middle, bottom 8, bottom 3)

### ✅ Product Positioning
- Consulting platform for LeadingWith.AI
- Consultants upload curated client data
- Platform presents findings to client executives
- Generates AI-powered insights and recommendations
- Professional reporting for leadership

### ✅ Files Created (New Architecture)

- `components/sentiment/ProblemCategoriesView.tsx` (172 lines)
  - Displays GPT-generated categories
  - Shows 3-5 top challenges
  - Click to view interventions

- `components/sentiment/InterventionsView.tsx` (241 lines)
  - 3 AI-generated actions
  - Expandable details
  - Resources, stakeholders, metrics

- `components/capability/CapabilityOverview.tsx` (253 lines)
  - 8-dimension radar (max/avg/min/benchmark)
  - Summary table
  - Click dimension for drilldown

- `components/capability/DimensionDrilldown.tsx` (228 lines)
  - 4-construct radar

- `app/assessment/page.tsx` (237 lines)
  - Main orchestrator
  - View state machine
  - Navigation between all views
  - Filter integration

#### Types
- `lib/types/assessment.ts` (76 lines)
  - Proper type definitions
  - ViewState union type
  - SentimentResponse, CapabilityResponse

## What Still Needs Work

### Priority 1: Data Integration
- [ ] Load actual capability data (currently empty array)
- [ ] Parse open-ended responses from capability CSV
- [ ] Validate data structures match real files

### Priority 2: View Completion
- [ ] Complete dimension drilldown rendering
- [ ] Add navigation between dimensions (prev/next)
- [ ] Proper state preservation when going back

### Priority 3: GPT Integration
- [ ] Add OpenAI API key to environment
- [ ] Test all GPT endpoints
- [ ] Add caching for expensive calls
- [ ] Implement fallbacks for API failures

### Priority 4: PDF Export
- [ ] Rebuild PDF generator with correct structure
- [ ] Include GPT-generated content
- [ ] Professional layout matching Excel quality

### Priority 5: Polish
- [ ] Loading states throughout
- [ ] Error boundaries
- [ ] Responsive design
- [ ] Accessibility

## Current Build Status

**Compiling**: Need to test  
**Imports**: Need to verify  
**Dependencies**: ✅ OpenAI SDK installed  
**Data**: ✅ Have sentiment_demo.csv (3,448 rows)  
**Missing**: Capability data in usable format  

## Estimated Completion Time

- Complete data integration: 3 hours
- Fix all view states: 2 hours
- Test GPT integration: 2 hours
- Polish and testing: 3 hours

**Total**: ~10 hours to production-ready

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Test current build
2. Fix any import/type errors
3. Load capability data properly
4. Test sentiment heatmap with real data
5. Test GPT problem category generation
6. Complete capability views
7. Rebuild PDF export
8. End-to-end testing

## ❌ Critical Gaps (Blocking MVP)

### 1. **GPT-4 Integration** 🔴 (4-5 hours)
**Impact**: Can't deliver core value proposition

**What's Missing:**
- Problem category generation from lowest cells
- 3 interventions per category
- Executive summary generation
- Open-ended text summarization

**Current State:**
- API routes exist (`/api/gpt/analyze`, `/api/gpt/interventions`, `/api/gpt/summary`)
- GPT prompts written
- Frontend components ready
- ❌ No OPENAI_API_KEY configured
- ❌ Untested with real API calls
- ❌ No error handling
- ❌ No caching

**What's Needed:**
1. Add OPENAI_API_KEY to .env.local
2. Test problem category generation
3. Test intervention generation
4. Add loading states
5. Add error handling with retry
6. Test with real sentiment data

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Click "Generate AI Recommendations" → See 3-5 problem categories
- Click category → See 3 actionable interventions
- All responses in <15 seconds
- Graceful degradation if API fails

---

### 2. **Capability Visualization** 🔴 (3-4 hours)
**Impact**: Only have 50% of product (sentiment only)

**What's Missing:**
- 8-dimension radar/diamond chart
- Proper benchmark comparison
- Dimension drilldown (4 constructs per dimension)
- Open-ended summary view
- Navigation between dimensions

**Current State:**
- ❌ CapabilityOverview component empty
- ❌ DimensionDrilldown component stub
- ❌ OpenEndedSummary component stub
- ✅ Metadata structure ready (dimensions.csv, constructs.csv)
- ✅ Types defined
- ✅ Calculation logic ready

**What's Needed:**
1. Build 8-point radar chart (use recharts)
2. Add benchmark comparison layer
3. Implement click → drilldown
4. Build 4-construct breakdown
5. Add navigation arrows
6. Connect to GPT for summaries

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- See 8-dimension radar with company vs benchmark
- Click any dimension → see 4 constructs
- Navigate through all 8 dimensions
- Professional visualization matching heatmap quality

---

### 3. **Real-Time Filtering** 🟡 (2-3 hours)
**Impact**: Can't segment data by department/region (key requirement)

**What's Missing:**
- Dynamic filter options from data
- Real-time recalculation
- Visual feedback when filtered
- "Showing X of Y" indicator

**Current State:**
- ❌ FilterPanel shows empty state
- ❌ No option population
- ❌ Doesn't trigger recalculation
- ✅ Filter types defined
- ✅ Calculation functions support filters

**What's Needed:**
1. Extract unique values from data (regions, departments, ages)
2. Populate filter dropdowns
3. Connect to calculation functions
4. Add "Showing X of Y responses" badge
5. Add clear/reset functionality
6. Persist filter state

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Select "Finance" → heatmap recalculates
- See "Showing 347 of 1,247 responses"
- Filter applies to both sentiment and capability
- Can reset filters

---

### 4. **PDF Export** 🟡 (2-3 hours)
**Impact**: Can't deliver final report to client

**What's Missing:**
- Professional 25-page report template
- Capture all visualizations
- Include recommendations
- Company branding

**Current State:**
- ❌ Export button exists but doesn't work
- ❌ pdfExport utility incomplete
- ✅ Data structure ready

**What's Needed:**
1. Use @react-pdf/renderer or jsPDF
2. Create report template
3. Capture heatmap as image
4. Capture capability chart as image
5. Format recommendations
6. Add company logo/branding

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Click export → Download professional PDF
- PDF includes all visualizations
- Recommendations formatted properly
- Under 5MB file size

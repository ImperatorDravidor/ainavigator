## 🎯 **The 30-Second Pitch**
"We help companies avoid the 67% AI failure rate by measuring BOTH employee sentiment AND organizational capability. You get data-driven insights showing exactly where resistance exists and which capabilities need building—so you can fix problems before they kill your AI initiatives."

---

## 📱 **Demo Flow - Follow This Sequence**

### **1. COMMAND CENTER** (Start here - 30sec)
**URL:** `/assessment`

**Show:**
- Overall Readiness: **46%** (below 70% goal)
- Sentiment: **1.3/5.0** = Resistant (orange/red)
- Capability: **4.1/7.0** = Intermediate (blue)
- Scroll capability table to show all 8 dimensions

**Say:** *"1000 employees surveyed. Overall readiness is 46%—people are resistant (1.3/5) but organization has moderate capability (4.1/7). Capability table shows exactly where gaps are."*

---

### **2. SENTIMENT ANALYSIS** (Click through - 60sec)
**Click:** "Explore Sentiment Data" button

**Actions:**
1. **Click "Show Heatmap Guide"** → Explain 5×5 grid
   - Rows = Concern levels (Personal → Organizational)
   - Columns = Why they're concerned (Autonomous, Inflexible, Opaque, etc.)
   - Colors = Relative ranking (Red = worst, Green = best)

2. **Click a RED cell** (e.g., bottom-right: score 2.42, rank #25)
   - Modal shows: score, count, ranking, description
   - *"This is our #25 ranking—most critical concern area"*

3. **Click Filter button** → Select a department
   - Heatmap updates in real-time
   - *"Real-time filtering by department, region, demographics"*

4. **Click "Generate AI Insights"** button
   - Shows loading animation (1.5 seconds)
   - Displays 3 problem categories with mock data
   - *"Our AI analyzes the data and identifies key themes"*

**Say:** *"This heatmap shows where resistance lives in your organization. Red cells are critical concerns—here, transparency issues at the organizational stability level affect 156 people."*

---

### **3. CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT** (Navigate - 60sec)
**Click:** Sidebar → "Capability" OR back button → "Analyze Capability Gaps"

**Actions:**
1. **Show 3 chart views** (click tabs at top)
   - **vs Benchmark:** Your score (teal) vs industry (purple dashed)
   - **Variance:** Max/Avg/Min spread (shows team alignment)
   - **Maturity:** Current vs full maturity target

2. **Switch benchmark filters** (bottom selector)
   - All Companies (150 companies)
   - Financial Services (42 companies)
   - North America (68 companies)
   - *"Compare against different peer groups"*

3. **Scroll the table**
   - 6-7 dimensions visible
   - Color-coded status (EXCEEDS/MEETS/BELOW)
   - Gap analysis with trends

**Say:** *"Capability diamond shows 8 dimensions of AI maturity. Data Infrastructure is your biggest gap—4.1 vs 5.5 benchmark. You can switch views to see variance, compare to different peer groups."*

---

### **4. REPORTS** (Optional - 15sec)
**Click:** Sidebar → "Reports & Export"

**Show:**
- Export PDF Report card
- PowerPoint Slides (coming soon)

**Say:** *"Everything packages into a 25-page board-ready PDF report with all findings and recommendations."*

---

## ⚠️ **What NOT to Click** (Not Fully Working)

- ❌ Individual dimension rows in capability table (drilldown incomplete)
- ❌ Problem category cards (interventions view has issues)
- ❌ Recommendations sidebar item (placeholder only)
- ❌ Actual PDF export (will fail without backend)

**If asked:** *"That's on our roadmap for next release"* or *"In production, this would show..."*

## 🔥 **Wow Moments** (Build to These)

1. **Sentiment heatmap color gradient** - Visual impact
2. **Click cell → Beautiful modal** - Polish & detail
3. **AI generating insights** - Loading animation → Results
4. **Switch chart views** - 3 perspectives on same data
5. **Benchmark switching** - Industry → Region → All
6. **Keyboard navigation** - Press 2 to jump to Sentiment

## 🚨 **If Something Breaks**

| Problem | Say This |
|---------|----------|
| GPT fails | "AI analysis typically generates custom insights. For demo, showing framework with sample data." |
| Filter doesn't work | "In production, this filters to Finance only. Framework supports unlimited segmentation." |
| PDF export fails | "Export generates comprehensive report. I have a sample here..." [show screenshot] |
| Page won't load | "Let me show you the PowerPoint version..." [have backup ready] |
